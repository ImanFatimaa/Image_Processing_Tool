# Image_Processing_Tool
# Objective:
The objective of this project is to create a basic image editor using OpenCV in C++. The image editor should provide a range of fundamental image manipulation functions to enable users to load, edit, and save images with ease. The system should adhere to objectoriented programming principles, employing classes and attributes to model the different aspects of the application. Key Features and Functionalities: 

# Image Loading and Saving:
Users should be able to load images from their local storage in various formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG, BMP). After editing, users should be able to save the modified images. 
# Image Display and Preview: 
The application should display the loaded image for users to view and edit. Users should have a preview of the edited image before saving the changes. 
# Basic  Image Editing Operations:

# Resizing: 
Users should be able to resize the image to specific dimensions while maintaining its aspect ratio.
# Cropping: 
Users should have the option to crop the image to a selected region. â€¢ Rotation: Users can rotate the image by a specified angle. 
# Filters: 
Basic filters like grayscale, blur, sharpen, and more should be available for image enhancement. 
# Brightness/Contrast Adjustment: 
Users can adjust the brightness and contrast of the image to enhance or tone down the colors. 
# Support for Multiple Image Formats: 
The image editor should support a variety of image formats to provide flexibility to users
